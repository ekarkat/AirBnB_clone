## Background Context

In this phase of the AirBnB Clone project, you will be developing the front-end incrementally. You'll start with the design, sketching, and prototyping of each element. Key milestones include:

1. Create simple HTML static pages.
2. Develop a style guide.
3. Populate the pages with dummy content.
4. Note that no JavaScript will be used, and no data will be fetched from external sources. HTML will define the structure, and CSS will handle the styling.
